# SIMON-GAME
The Simon Game project is a web-based implementation of classic memory game, designed to challenge users recall abilities by having them replicate increasingly complex sequences of colors. The main objective of this project is to create an interactive and engaging game that combines retro design aesthetics with modern web development techniques.
